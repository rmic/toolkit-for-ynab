# List of YNAB Toolkit Features

<details><summary>General (Click to Expand/Collapse)</summary>

## Account Name Height

Makes the account names smaller so that you can see more of the account names and fit more on the screen.

## Add Copy Transactions to Activity Modals

Adds a button to copy transactions displayed in the various Activity Modals (Budget and Reports pages).

## Better scrollbars

Provides smaller and cleaner scrollbars across the application.

## Budget Quick Switch

Adds the list of budgets to the Open Budget dropdown so you don't have to navigate to the 'Open Budget' page to switch budgets.

## Colour Blind Mode

Changes colours like red, yellow and green in the interface to colours and shapes that are more easily distinguishable by colourblind people.

## Hide Account Balances

Allows you to hide account type totals and/or account balances.

## Hide Closed Accounts

This feature hides the closed accounts section in the side menu. View the account-options popup (click your e-mail) to show or hide the closed accounts.

## Hide Edit Account Button

Allows you to hide the edit account button to help prevent accidentally clicking on it.

## Hide Help (?) Button

This feature hides the blue help (?) button in the bottom right corner of the screen. View the account-options popup (click your e-mail) to show or hide the help button.

## Hide Referral Banner

YNAB shows a "Share YNAB, Get YNAB free" banner. If you'd rather not see this banner, you can turn this feature on to hide it.

## Interface Font

Select a font from the Google Fonts library or choose to use your system font.

## Localization of YNAB

Localization of interface.

## Navigation Tabs Height

Makes the navigation tabs (Budget, Reports, etc) smaller, and with less padding, so that you can see more of the sidebar on the screen.

## POS-style currency entry mode

Allow entry of currency values without decimal separators (as done in real-life on POS terminals). For example, entering a figure of "500" will expand to "5.00". Values containing decimal separator of current account are left unmodified (e.g. "50.00" will stay "50.00"). As a shorthand, values ending with "-" will be expanded to full monetary unit (e.g. "50-" will result in "50.00"). Math operations are supported as well (e.g. "50\*5" becomes "2.50").

## Printing Improvements

Changes print styles so budget and account sections can be easily printed. Due to the number of columns, the account section should be printed using landscape orientation.

## Privacy Mode

Obscures dollar amounts everywhere until hovered. In toggle mode, a lock icon will appear in the lower left corner of YNAB. Click to enable or disable privacy mode.

## Show Import Notifications in Navigation Sidebar

Underline account names in the navigation sidebar that have transactions to be imported. Hovering the mouse over the account name will display the number of transactions to be imported.

<details><summary>Budget (Click to Expand/Collapse)</summary>

## Add "Enter" Shortcut to the Move Popup

Pressing Enter in the Move Popup acts like clicking the OK button, instead of losing focus or doing nothing.

## Add Goals Indication

Add indicators for subcategories with goals. Types: (M)onthly goal, target by (D)ate goal, (T)arget without date, and (U)pcoming transactions.

## Add Pacing to the Budget

Add a column for 'pacing' which shows you how much money you've spent based on how far you are through the month. Note that clicking on the pacing value will toggle emphasis, allowing you to selectively enable the feature per category.

## Allow Markdown in Notes

Adds Markdown parsing to notes, allowing support for links, bullet points, and other formatting tools. Learn how to use Markdown [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet).

For example, on 11th January with Age of Money = 10, Date of Money would be 1st January.

## Days Of Buffering Metric - Date

Hover the mouse over Days of Buffering to display the equivalent Date for Days of Buffering.
For example, on 1st January with Days of Buffering = 10, Date of Buffering would be 11th January.

## Days of Buffering History Lookup

How old transactions should be used for average daily outflow calculation.

## Days of Buffering Metric

This calculation shows how long your money would likely last if you never earned another cent based on your average spending. We know that no month is 'average' but this should give you some idea of how much of a buffer you have. Equal to budget accounts total divided by the average daily outflow. That comes from sum of all outflow transactions from on budget accounts only divided by the age of budget in days. You can also change the number of days taken into account by this metric with the 'Days of Buffering History Lookup' setting.

## Display Target Goal Amount And Overbudget Warning

Adds a 'Goal' column which displays the target goal amount for every category with a goal, and a warning in red if you have budgeted beyond your goal.

## Display Total Monthly Goals

Adds a 'Total Monthly Goals' to the budget inspector, which displays the total amount of monthly funding goals.

## Enable Categories Filter

Enable textbox at budget page for categories filtering

## Goal Indicator Warning Color

## Height of Budget Rows

Makes the budget rows skinnier than the default YNAB style so that you can fit more on the screen.

## Hide Age of Money Calculation
